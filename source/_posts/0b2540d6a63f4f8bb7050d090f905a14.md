**Who Invented the Banana Boulevardier?**

*(makes 3-4 servings)*

4 oz Four Roses Single Barrel Bourbon

2 oz Velier Hampden 46 Jamaican Rum

3 oz Cocchi di Torino Sweet Vermouth

1.5 oz Tempus Fugit Creme de Banana

1 oz Campari

Don't have a sous vide at home? (lol) Here's how to infuse using a modified technique:

- Add Boulevardier batch and one really ripe banana to a large ziplock bag and seal — squeezing out as much air as possible.
- Fill the pot with hot water ¾ of the way to the top and bring to 140 degrees. Submerge the bag until all of the batch is in the hot water and use a clothes pin to clip the top of the bag to the side of the pot.
- Simmer for 2 hours
- When timer goes off, remove the bag, dump the hot water and fill the pot with ice and water.
- Place the sealed bag in the ice water for 5 minutes.
- Unlock the top corner of the bag and strain into a bottle or decanter and place in refrigerator.

To serve:

Pour 4 oz of batch into a mixing glass with ice and stir for 5 seconds. Strain over a big rock in an old fashioned glass. Garnish with expressions from lemon and orange peels, discard the peels.
