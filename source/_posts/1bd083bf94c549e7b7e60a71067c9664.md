## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil
- [ ] 4 oz. pancetta (Italian bacon), chopped
- [ ] 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage
- [ ] 2 lb kabocha or butternut squash, peeled, seeded, cut into 1/2" pieces
- [ ] 1 small onion chopped
- [ ] 2 garlic cloves chopped
- [ ] Kosher salt
- [ ] Black pepper
- [ ] 2 cups chicken broth
- [ ] 12 oz. fettuccine or linguine
- [ ] 1/4 cup pecorino

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pancetta, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 8–10 minutes. Add sage and toss to coat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pancetta and sage to a small bowl; set aside.
2. Add squash, onion, and garlic to skillet; season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, 8–10 minutes. Add broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until squash is soft and liquid is reduced by half, 15–20 minutes. Let cool slightly, then purée in a blender until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Reserve skillet.
3. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.
4. Combine pasta, squash purée, and ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid in reserved skillet and cook over medium heat, tossing and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce coats pasta, about 2 minutes. Mix in ¼ cup Pecorino; season with salt and pepper.
5. Serve pasta topped with reserved pancetta and sage, shaved Pecorino, and more pepper.

- **DO AHEAD:** Squash purée can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
