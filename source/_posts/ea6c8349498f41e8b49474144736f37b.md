The dough is very soft and soft and Sticky. I would maybe quarter or half the recipe. Also grandma helped me and she said that when you pour the remaining melted butter do it a little at a time around the edge of the bowl and then use your hand to incorporate the butter in a circular motion. You don’t really knead it. Be gentle. Good luck!

Also mom says to use some of the melted butter on your hands too as needed.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 pkg dry yeast
- [ ] 1/3 cup lukewarm water
- [ ] &#x20;1 tsp. sugar
- [ ] &#x20;13 cups flour (a bit less than a 5 lb bag)
- [ ] &#x20;3 1/4 cups warm milk
- [ ] &#x20;3 1/2 cups sugar
- [ ] &#x20;2 tsp. salt
- [ ] &#x20;8 eggs
- [ ] &#x20;½ tsp. yellow food coloring
- [ ] &#x20;½ c. butter
- [ ] &#x20;½ c. shortening

## Instructions

Sift together flour, sugar and salt into large bowl. Dissolve dry yeast in water; sprinkle sugar and let stand. Beat eggs. Add warm milk and coloring. Melt butter and shortening. Make a well on one side of flour mixture; add egg and milk mixture, dissolved yeast and half of butter and shortening, keeping the rest for later. Mix by hand until all flour is used, then pour remaining melted butter under dough and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, using more shortening to rub hands if too sticky. Shape into ball, cover and let rise a second time until doubied, about 1½ hours. Grease pans and form dough into loaves or rolls. Let rise until doubled in bulk and bake for 30-40 minutes for loaves and 25 minutes for rolls in a 350° oven. Brush top with butter while still hot. Makes about 6 loaves.
