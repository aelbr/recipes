**Coconaut**

2 oz Plantation Xamayca (funky aged Jamaican rum)

2 oz coconut cream

1 oz fresh lime juice

*Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with one cup crushed ice. (You can just bust up a bunch of freezer ice with a rolling pin!) Give it a good shake for about 5 seconds, then pour the entire contents into your cutest glass (we call that a 'dirty dump' lol). Top with more crushed ice, and garnish with tropical things!*
